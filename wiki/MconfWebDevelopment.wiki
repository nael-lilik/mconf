#summary Mconf-Web development

= Mconf-Web Development =

MConf-web uses Rails 3 and Ruby 1.9.2.

== Setting up the development environment ==

  * First, install Ruby. We recommend the use of [http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ RVM], so we've made a [RVMQuickSteps brief guide] to show you how to install it.

  * Clone mconf-web:
    {{{
git clone git://github.com/mconf/mconf-web.git
    }}}

  * To proceed, you need to install some system packages and gems (libraries) used by Mconf-web. The system packages can be installed using the script called "setup" and the gems are installed using the standard Ruby "bundler":
    {{{
script/setup development
gem install bundler && bundle install
    }}}

  * Set up your system (it creates some configuration files and updates git submodules):
    {{{
rake setup:basic
    }}}

  * Configuration files. The command above created some files that you need to configure to be able to run the application. They are already formatted with a standard structure, but some information is sensible and unique for each setup, so *you really need* to edit them. The files are:
    * *<tt>config/database.yml</tt>*: configures the database.
      The default file uses sqlite for development and testing and mysql for production, but you can change it. There are examples files both for sqlite (<tt>database.yml.sqlite.example</tt>) and mysql (<tt>database.yml.mysql.example</tt>). Note: You will probably need to insert a password if you're using mysql.
    * *<tt>config/setup_conf.yml</tt>* contains the basic configuration data that will be used during the database setup and when the application is initialized.
      See [MconfWebSetupConf this page] for more details on how to configure this file.

  * Setup the database. It will drop and recreate your _development_ database, create basic data (<b>you need</b> this data to run the application) and populate the db with test data.
    {{{
rake setup:db
    }}}

  * Run the command below to start the server and open your browser and go to <tt>localhost:3000</tt>.
    {{{
rails server
    }}}

== Configuring the website ==

The basic configurations are in <tt>config/setup_conf.yml</tt>. See [MconfWebSetupConf this page] for more details on how to configure this file.
