#summary Mconf-Web development

= Mconf-Web Development =

Mconf-web uses Rails 3 and Ruby 1.9.2-p290.

== Setting up the development environment ==

You can do it either manually (see below) or using the [MconfWebMconfWebConf#Usage_Scenarios script mconf-web-conf] (see the usage scenario for a development environment).

=== Manual setup ===

  * First, install Ruby. We recommend the use of [http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ RVM]. See [http://beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/ this page] to now how to install it (use the single-user installation). After RVM is installed, install Ruby and create a gemset for mconf with:
    {{{
rvm install 1.9.2-p290
rvm gemset create mconf
rvm use --default 1.9.2-p290@mconf
    }}}

  * Clone mconf-web:
    {{{
git clone git://github.com/mconf/mconf-web.git
    }}}

  * To proceed, you need to install some system packages used by Mconf-web. The packages are listed in a file that you can find at [https://github.com/mconf/mconf-web/blob/master/config/packages.ubuntu config/packages.ubuntu]. You can download this file and install the packages with:
    {{{
curl https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/master/config/packages.ubuntu -o packages.ubuntu
source packages.ubuntu
sudo apt-get install ${PACKAGES_DEVELOPMENT[@]}
rm packages.ubuntu
    }}}

   * Then install the gems with:
    {{{
gem install bundler && bundle install
    }}}

  * Set up your system (it creates some configuration files and updates git submodules):
    {{{
rake setup:basic
    }}}

  * Configuration files. The command above created some files that you need to configure to be able to run the application. They are already formatted with a standard structure, but some information is sensible and unique for each setup, so *you really need* to edit them. The files are:
    * *<tt>config/database.yml</tt>*: configures the database. See [MconfWebSetupConf#Configuring_the_database_(_database.yml_) this page] for more details about this file.
    * *<tt>config/setup_conf.yml</tt>* contains the basic configuration data that will be used during the database setup and when the application is initialized. See [MconfWebSetupConf#Configuring_the_application_(_setup_conf.yml_) this page] for more details about this file.

  * Setup the database. It will drop and recreate your _development_ database, create basic data (<b>you need</b> this data to run the application) and populate the db with test data.
    {{{
rake setup:db
    }}}

  * Run the command below to start the server and open your browser and go to <tt>localhost:3000</tt>.
    {{{
rails server
    }}}

== Fake test data ==

You can create fake data in your development database using the following rake task:

    {{{
rake setup:populate
    }}}

It will create users, spaces, posts and everything you need to have a populated web site and test your modifications.

== Testing ==

Proceed to [MconfWebTesting this page].

== Development Tips ==

Proceed to [MconfWebDevelopmentTips this page].

== Configuring the website ==

The basic configurations are in <tt>config/setup_conf.yml</tt>. See [MconfWebSetupConf this page] for more details on how to configure this file.

Also, if you login as administrator, you can access the management area (`/manage`) where you can edit most of the available configurations for the website.
