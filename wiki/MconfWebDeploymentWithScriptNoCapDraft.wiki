= Mconf-Web Deployment With mconf-web-conf =

== Overview ==

This guide is destined to those who search for an easy way to install Mconf-Web or those who doesn't have experience with Ruby/Rails applications.

If you're searching for a more flexible installation, see the [MconfWebDeploymentManual manual installation guide].

== Starting ==

For more details about the script see [MconfWebMconfWebConf this page]. You can download and install it with:

{{{
sudo curl https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/master/script/mconf-web-conf -o /usr/local/bin/mconf-web-conf
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/mconf-web-conf
}}}

The steps you will need to install the application are:

  # Install dependencies (system packages);
  # Install ruby;
  # Install the web server and download the application;
  # Edit some configuration files;
  # Finaly, deploy.

*Note:* Don't run the commands as sudo. When superuser permissions are required the script will ask you for a password.

=== 1. System Packages ===

{{{
mconf-web-conf --install-packages production
}}}

=== 2. Ruby (using RVM) ===

{{{
mconf-web-conf --install-ruby
}}}

Ruby will be installed using [http://beginrescueend.com/ RVM], as multi-user. This means that ruby will be available to all users.

=== 3. Install web server and download the aplication ===

This command will install the web server and checkout the source code for Mconf-Web.

{{{
mconf-web-conf --setup-deploy
}}}

If you're installing Mconf-Web in a standalone machine, the script will ask you if you want to use Apache or Nginx. You can use the one you prefer.

If you're installing Mconf-Web in the same machine where you already have !BigBlueButton, you should use Apache for Mconf-Web. If you decide to use Nginx, you'll have to configure it manually (see more about this issue [MconfWebDeployInBBBMachine in this page]).

=== 4. Edit the configuration files ===

There are two files that need to be configured. At first, copy the example files:

{{{
cp mconf-web/config/setup_conf.yml.example mconf-web/config/setup_conf.yml
cp mconf-web/config/database.yml.example mconf-web/config/database.yml
}}}

Then edit the files `setup_conf.yml` and `database.yml`. *To configure these files, see [MconfWebSetupConf this page]*.

`setup_conf.yml` has general configurations for the web application and `database.yml` configures the database. By default, MySQL will be used. If you haven't set up a password for MySQL yet, you can do it with:

{{{
mysqladmin -u root password "NEW-PASSWORD"
}}}

Or, in case you want to change the password:

{{{
mysqladmin -u root -p password "NEW-PASSWORD"
}}}

=== 5. Deploy ===

{{{
mconf-web-conf --deploy
}}}
