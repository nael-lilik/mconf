#summary Configuring the application through setup_conf.yml

= Configuring the application (`setup_conf.yml`) =

This file contains the configurations that are either loaded in the database when it is created or that are loaded in memory when the application is loaded.

Remember to keep the file indented and formatted as it is. Its format and structure have semantic meaning, so you shouldn't change them.

== Structure ==

The file has several sections. In the first level, you can have four:
  * default
  * development
  * production
  * test

The "default" section is always present and its values are used as the default values. The other sections are used to define specific configurations for each Rails environment (development, production, test). In these other sections you should specify only the parameters you want to override over the default configurations.

Inside the default section, you will find the sections listed below.

=== Admin user ===

This area defines the administrator user. Use a valid email and you can use a simple password here, since you are able to change it later on through the website.

Currently this will be the only admin user in your application.

{{{
admin_login: "mconf"     	       	       	       # admin's login
admin_fullname: "Mconf Admin"    	       	       # admin's full name
admin_email: "my-email@server.com"       	       # admin's email
admin_password: "admin"  	       	       	       # admin's password
}}}

=== !BigBlueButton server ===

Defines the first and default !BigBlueButton server. This is used during the setup of your DB, but you're able to modify it later on using the website.

Currently, all !BigBlueButton rooms created through Mconf-web will use this server.

  * The <tt>url</tt> should use the format "<tt>http://{server}/bigbluebutton/api</tt>". Change only the <tt>{server}</tt> part.

{{{
bbb_server_name: 'Default Server'                                 # server name
bbb_server_url: 'http://my-development-server/bigbluebutton/api'  # server url in the	format http://<server>/bigbluebutton/api
bbb_server_salt: 'my-secret-salt'                                 # server salt
bbb_server_version: '0.7'                                         # bbb version
}}}

=== Sending emails ===

Currently Mconf-Web uses a Gmail account to send emails, so you can use this section to enter your username and password.

You *need* to set up this account. Currently the website is not guaranteed to work if you don't do it.

{{{                                                                                                                                
sendmail_username: "my-username@gmail.com"  	       # gmail username
sendmail_password: "my-password"    	       	       # gmail password
}}}

=== Website ===

The information is used to create the a Site model, that defines some attributes of your website. They can be altered after the initial setup using the management area in the application.

{{{
site_name: "Mconf Dev"  	       	       	# website name
site_description: "Mconf Development Website"   # website description
site_email: "my-email@server.com"       	# website contact email
site_locale: "en"                               # this will be the default locale for the application
site_domain: "localhost"                        # your server address
site_signature: "Mconf"                         # to sign emails
}}}

=== Default space === 

When you set up the database a default space will be created, something like "a space for all members of this website". You can define here some attributes for this space.

{{{
default_space_name: "Mconf-Web Space"                    # space's name
default_space_description: "Mconf-Web users space"       # space's description
}}}

=== Notifications when the site breaks === 

Notifies (by email) when an exception occurs. This feature *will only work in the production environment*^1^, so it is disabled by default. You will usually configure it in the default section and then enable it in the production section.

{{{
exception_notification_enabled: "false"                                          # change to true to enable, don't use quotation marks
exception_notification_prefix: "[mconf-web error] "                              # prefix added in the email subject
exception_notification_recipients: "my-email@server.com my-email2@server.com"    # space-separated list of emails
}}}

And to enable it in production:

{{{
production:
  exception_notification_enabled: "true"
}}}

_^1^Because the gem exception_notification that does it is only installed for production._
