#summary Configuring the application through setup_conf.yml

= Configuring the application (`setup_conf.yml`) =

This file contains the configurations that are either loaded in the database when it is created or that are loaded in memory when the application is loaded.

Remember to keep the file indented and formatted as it is. Its format and structure have semantic meaning, so you shouldn't change them.

== Structure ==

The file has several sections. In the first level, you can have four:
  * default
  * development
  * production
  * test

The "default" section is always present and its values are used as the default values. The other sections are used to define specific configurations for each Rails environment (development, production, test). In these other sections you should specify only the parameters you want to override over the default configurations.

Inside the default section, you will find the sections listed below.

=== Admin user ===

This area defines the administrator user. Use a valid email and you can use a simple password here, since you are able to change it later on through the website.

Currently this will be the only admin user in your application.

{{{
  admin:
    login: "mconf"     	       	       	       # admin's login
    fullname: "Mconf Admin"    	       	       # admin's full name
    email: "my-email@server.com"       	       # admin's email
    password: "admin"  	       	       	       # admin's password
}}}

=== !BigBlueButton server ===

Defines the first and default !BigBlueButton server. Currently, all !BigBlueButton rooms created through Mconf-web will use this server.

  * The <tt>url</tt> should use the format "<tt>http://{server}/bigbluebutton/api</tt>". Change only the <tt>{server}</tt> part.

{{{
  bbb_server:
    name: 'Default Server'     	       	       	       	   # server name
    url: 'http://my-development-server/bigbluebutton/api'  # server url in the	format http://<server>/bigbluebutton/api
    salt: 'my-secret-salt'     	       	       	       	   # server salt
    version: '0.7'     	       	       	       	       	   # bbb version
}}}

=== Sending emails ===

Currently Mconf-Web uses a Gmail account to send emails, so you can use this section to enter your username and password.

You *need* to set up this account. Currently the website is not guaranteed to work if you don't do it.

{{{                                                                                                                                
  sendmail:
    username: "my-username@gmail.com"  	       # gmail username
    password: "my-password"    	       	       # gmail password
}}}

=== Website ===

The information is used to create the a Site model, that defines some attributes of your website. They can be altered after the initial setup using the management area in the application.

{{{
  site:
    name: "Mconf Dev"  	       	       	       # website name
    description: "Mconf Development Website"   # website description
    email: "my-email@server.com"       	       # website contact email
    locale: "en"                               # this will be the default locale for the application
    domain: "localhost"                        # your server address
    signature: "Mconf"                         # to sign emails
}}}

=== Default space === 

When you set up the database a default space will be created, something like "a space for all members of this website". You can define here some attributes for this space.

{{{
  default_space:
    name: "Mconf-Web Space"    	       	       # space's name
    description: "Mconf-Web users space"       # space's description
}}}

=== Notifications when the site breaks === 

Notifies (by email) when an exception occurs. This feature *will only work in the production environment*^1^, so it is disabled by default. You will usually configure it in the default section and then enable it in the production section.

{{{
exception_notification:
    enabled: false                                            # change to true to enable, don't use quotation marks
    prefix: "[mconf-web error] "                              # prefix added in the email subject
    recipients: "my-email@server.com my-email2@server.com"    # space-separated list of emails
}}}

And to enable it in production:

{{{
production:
  exception_notification:
    enabled: true
}}}

_^1^Because the gem exception_notification that does it is only installed for production._
