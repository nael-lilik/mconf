= Mconf-Live =

Mconf-Live is an open source webconference system based on [http://bigbluebutton.org BigBlueButton]. It is part of the Mconf project, which includes a web portal with social network characteristcs, a mobile client and a Global Webconference Network with load balancing, real-time monitoring and usage reports.

Since the Mconf Network (you can read more about it [http://mconf.org/m/about/network here]) is currently the focus of our project, we only provide instructions for installing Mconf-Live instances *that will be integrated in the network*. We currently don't provide scripts and instructions for standalone installations, even though it is possible.

To read how to install Mconf-Live and join the Global Network, see the [MconfNetwork Mconf Global Network wiki page].
