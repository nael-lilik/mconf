= Deployment =

Mconf-web is a Rails application, so the deployment process is very similar to the deployment of any other Rails application.

The server setup we have right now, and thus the recommended setup, uses the following:

  # [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] 10.04 operating system
  # Ruby is installed with [https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ RVM]
  # [http://www.modrails.com/ Phusion Passenger]
  # [http://nginx.net/ Nginx] is the web server
  # Mysql2 database
  # [https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano Capistrano] helps you run commands on the server from your development environment

The following guide will instruct you on how to setup exactly this environment.

Mconf-web should work in any operating system that has Ruby available (and most of them do have Ruby). Changing the items 1 and 2 might only require changes in the applications (packages) you'll need to install. But changes in the items 3 to 5 will certainly require modifications in the configuration files and maybe even some code changes.

== 1. System setup ==

=== Ubuntu ===

First, setup a standard [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] installation and create a user `mconf` with a password:

{{{
sudo useradd mconf
sudo passwd mconf
}}}

Login as `mconf` and clone Mconf-web:

{{{
git clone git://github.com/mconf/mconf-web.git
}}}

Mconf-web requires some packages to be installed in your OS. The script [https://github.com/mconf/mconf-web/blob/master/script/setup setup] can help with that, but first you're going to need to install Ruby.

=== RVM ===

To install Ruby using RVM follow our [RVMQuickSteps quick steps] or check [https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ RVM's website].
