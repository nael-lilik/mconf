#summary How to deploy Mconf-Web

= Deployment =

Mconf is developed in and targeted to Ubuntu systems. We recommend the use of Ubuntu 10.04 (the latest LTS version, the same used by !BigBlueButton), but it has been tested in newer versions and should work as well.

But you can of course adapt it to your needs. Mconf-web is a Rails application, so the deployment process is very similar to the deployment of any other Rails application.

The server setup we have right now, and thus the recommended setup, uses the following:

  # [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] 10.04 operating system.
  # Ruby is installed with [https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ RVM].
  # [http://www.modrails.com/ Phusion Passenger] (ruby app server).
  # [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache] (but you can also use [http://nginx.net/ Nginx]).
  # [http://www.mysql.com/ MySQL] database.
  # Optionally, [https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano Capistrano]. It helps you run commands on the server from your development environment.

The following guides will instruct you on how to setup this environment.

Mconf-web should work on any operating system that has Ruby available (and most of them do have Ruby). Changing any of these items will probably require modifications in the configuration files and scripts (and maybe even some code changes).

== Deployment guides ==

Basically all you need to start is a machine with Ubuntu (10.04 is recommended) and a user (suggested name: "mconf").

From now on, you can either install everything manually or use the script `mconf-web-conf` to help you with these tasks:

  * *[MconfWebDeploymentWithScript Using mconf-web-conf]*: This is the easier option. You'll use a script called `mconf-web-conf` that will install and configure everything it can and ask for your help in things it cannot do automatically. If you chose this option, take a look at the manual installation if you're having problems.

  * *[MconfWebDeploymentManual Manual installation]*: This is a detailed guide showing how to install Mconf-Web. It allows a more flexible installation and can also help you find errors in your setup, but will require more time to be completed.
