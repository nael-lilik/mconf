#summary How to deploy Mconf-Web

= Deployment =

Mconf is developed in and targeted to Ubuntu systems. We recommend the use of an specific version of Ubuntu (see below), but it has been tested in newer versions and should work as well (however you might have to adapt some of the instructions).

The recommended setup for the latest version of Mconf-Web is:

  # [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] 12.04 operating system with a user named `mconf`.
  # Ruby is installed with [https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ RVM].
  # [http://www.modrails.com/ Phusion Passenger] (ruby app server).
  # [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache] (but you can also use [http://nginx.net/ Nginx]).
  # [http://www.mysql.com/ MySQL] database.
  # Optionally, [https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano Capistrano]. Recommended only if you are a developer.

The following guides will instruct you on how to setup this environment.

You can of course adapt it to your needs. Mconf-web is a Rails application, so the deployment process is very similar to the deployment of any other Rails application. It should work on any operating system that has Ruby available (and most of them do have Ruby). Changing any of these items will probably require modifications in the configuration files and scripts (and maybe even some code changes).


== Deployment guides ==

Basically all you need to start is a machine with Ubuntu and a user (suggested name: `mconf`).

  * *[MconfWebDeploymentManual Manual installation]*: This is a detailed guide showing how to install Mconf-Web. It allows a more flexible installation and can also help you find errors in your setup. *If you a setting up a real production server (not a test), follow this guide, so you will know what you're doing in your server*.

  * *[MconfWebDeploymentWithCapistrano Using Capistrano]*: Capistrano is very useful for developers that want to deploy the application and be able to easily update it. It requires a development environment and at least some basic knowledge of Ruby and Rails. This is how we maintain https://mconf.org.
