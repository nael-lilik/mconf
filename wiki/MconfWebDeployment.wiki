= Deployment =

Mconf-web is a Rails application, so the deployment process is very similar to the deployment of any other Rails application.

The server setup we have right now, and thus the recommended setup, uses the following:

  # [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] 10.04 operating system
  # Ruby is installed with [https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ RVM]
  # [http://www.modrails.com/ Phusion Passenger] (ruby app server)
  # [http://nginx.net/ Nginx] (web server)
  # [http://www.mysql.com/ MySQL] database
  # [https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano Capistrano] helps you run commands on the server from your development environment

The following guide will instruct you on how to setup *exactly* this environment.

  <font color="red">*Important:*</font> The following guide assumes that you have already a development environment configured. After you set up a basic server, the rest of the deployment will be done remotely from the development environment (using Capistrano). So take a look at [MconfWeb our wiki home] to set up your development environment.

Mconf-web should work in any operating system that has Ruby available (and most of them do have Ruby). Changing any of these items will certainly require modifications in the configuration files and scripts (and maybe even some code changes in some cases).

== 1. System setup ==

=== Ubuntu ===

First, setup a standard [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] installation and create a user `mconf` with a password:

{{{
sudo useradd mconf
sudo passwd mconf
}}}

To proceed with the setup of Mconf-web you will need to install some tools that will help you in the process (*ssh server*, *git*, and *curl*) and *ruby*.

=== Basic Tools ===

In Ubuntu, you can install them with:

{{{
sudo apt-get install openssh-server git curl
}}}

=== Ruby and RVM ===

Mconf-web uses Ruby *1.9.2*. To install Ruby, we suggest the use of RVM. There are scripts in Mconf-web that assume you have RVM installed, so you should use it unless you can't do it for some reason.

You can install RVM following our [RVMQuickSteps quick steps] or following [https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/ RVM's install page].

If you decided to use RVM, don't forget to actually install Ruby (and not only RVM) and create a gemset for Mconf-web:

{{{
rvm install 1.9.2
rvm gemset create mconf
rvm use --default 1.9.2@mconf
}}}


=== System Packages ===

As for the development environment, you will need to install system packages to run Mconf-web in production. The packages are listed in the ruby script at [https://github.com/mconf/mconf-web/blob/master/script/setup script/setup]. To download the script and use it, run:

{{{
curl https://github.com/mconf/mconf-web/raw/master/script/setup -o - | ruby - production
}}}

You will be prompted to type a password for MySQL in case you don't have it installed yet.

=== Nginx + Passenger ===

Nginx and Phusion Passenger are used to server the application. To install them, first install Passenger (it's a gem) and then it will help you download, compile and install Nginx. Actually, it will do it all for you. Run the following commands:

{{{
gem install passenger
rvmsudo passenger-install-nginx-module
}}}

The application `passenger-install-nginx-module` is a installer that guides you through the installation of Nginx for Passenger. It's steps are:

  # Check for required software: If your system is missing any required software, it will warn you and tell you how to install them;
  # Automatically download and install Nginx: Select the option *"1. Yes"*;
  # Where do you want to install Nginx to: You can choose the default location (just press enter). Nginx will be compiled and installed;
  # It will edit Nginx configuration file for you and give you an example of how to deploy an application. Ignore the example for now, the next step of this guide will show you the specific configurations for Mconf-web.

See more about Passenger at [http://www.modrails.com/ their website] and [http://www.modrails.com/videos/passenger_nginx.mov check this video] to see how it can be installed along with Nginx.

==== Nginx Configuration ====

If you installed Nginx in the default location, it's configuration file will be at `/opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf`.

Open this file and add the following content inside the `http` block, above the other `server` block. 

{{{
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your.ip.or.domain;
    root /home/mconf/mconf-web/current/public;
    passenger_enabled on;
    if (-f $document_root/system/maintenance.html) {
        rewrite ^(.*)$ /system/maintenance.html break;
    }
}
}}}

  <font color="red">*Important:*</font> Don't forget to change *`your.ip.or.domain`* by the IP or domain name of your server.

You can find an example of the nginx.conf we use at our repository [https://github.com/mconf/mconf-web/blob/master/config/nginx.conf.example here].

Since Passenger installs Nginx from source code, you won't have the script to start/stop Nginx. So we copied the script generated when you install the Nginx package in Ubuntu and made it available [https://github.com/mconf/mconf-web/blob/master/config/nginx.init.example here]. Download it to your server with:

{{{
sudo curl https://github.com/mconf/mconf-web/raw/master/config/nginx.init.example -o /etc/init.d/nginx
}}}

Now you can start/stop/restart Nginx with:

{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx stop
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
}}}

Start your web server now, open your browser and try to access it. You should see a page with the error "404 Not Found". This is ok, Nginx can't find the application because it was not deployed yet.

== 2. Deploy ==

After the previous steps, your server is configured and you can start to deploy the application. The following steps are all executed from your _development_ environment using Capistrano.

=== Capistrano ===

Capistrano is a ruby gem that helps you deploy applications. All it's configurations and tasks are in the file [https://github.com/mconf/mconf-web/blob/master/config/deploy.rb config/deploy.rb].

If you intend to deploy Mconf-web only once, without any code modifications, you just need to run a set of commands and the application will be deployed, so check the section *Deploying Once*. If you're planning on making code changes and deploying these changes, we suggest that you adapt `deploy.rb` and do some other things, as you can read in *Deploy and Develop*.

==== Deploying Once ====

Our deploy has a task called `setup:all` that can be used to setup a server for the first time. Run:

{{{
SERVER=your.ip.or.domain cap deploy:all
}}}

  <font color="red">*Important:*</font> Replace *your.ip.or.domain* by your server's IP or domain name.

This task will do the following:
  * Create the basic directories in the server;
  * Checkout Mconf-web from github (using the branch "`stable`") and make it available to be served by Nginx;
  * Setup the database (with the basic data needed).

  <font color="red">*Important:*</font> The configuration files used in your development environment will be uploaded to the production server. So make sure you configured them. If you change any of them and need to upload to the production server, run:
  {{{
SERVER=your.ip.or.domain cap deploy:update
  }}}

==== Deploy and Develop ====

If you're going to develop and deploy, you will for sure deploy your application more than once. To make things easy, first edit `config/deploy.rb` to adapt the following parameters:

  * Server: search for "`set :servers`" and set the production and test servers to your domains/IPs;
  * Repository: if you forked Mconf-web, search for "`set :repository`" and point it to your fork;
  * Branches: to change the branch being deployed (the default is "`stable`"), search for "`set :branches`" and point it to your branches.

If you need to customize anything else, take a look at the top lines of `deploy.rb`, it is fairly simple to understand and adapt.

To deploy for the first time, run:

{{{
cap deploy:all
}}}

The other tasks you will most likely need are:

{{{
cap deploy:all          # first time setup of a server
cap deploy:setup        # first setup, create directories
cap deploy:udpate       # update a new release
cap deploy:migrate      # run migrations
cap deploy:restart      # restart Nginx
cap deploy:web:disable  # start maintenance mode (the site will be offline)
cap deploy:web:enable   # stop maintenance mode (the site will be online)
}}}
