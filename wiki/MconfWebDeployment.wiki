= Deployment =

Mconf-web is a Rails application, so the deployment process is very similar to the deployment of any other Rails application.

The server setup we have right now, and thus the recommended setup, uses the following:

  # [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] 10.04 operating system
  # Ruby is installed with [https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ RVM]
  # [http://www.modrails.com/ Phusion Passenger] (ruby app server)
  # [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache] (but you can also use [http://nginx.net/ Nginx])
  # [http://www.mysql.com/ MySQL] database
  # [https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano Capistrano] helps you run commands on the server from your development environment

The following guide will instruct you on how to setup this environment.

Mconf-web should work on any operating system that has Ruby available (and most of them do have Ruby). Changing any of these items will certainly require modifications in the configuration files and scripts (and maybe even some code changes in some cases).

  <font color="red">*Important:*</font> The deployment of Mconf-Web has two steps: (1) configuring the server and (2) deploying the application. To deploy the application you need to have a development environment configured. After you set up a basic server (1), the rest of the deployment is done remotely from the development environment (using Capistrano). So take a look at [MconfWebDevelopment this page] to learn how to set up your development environment.

== (0) First steps ==

Basically all you need to start is a machine with Ubuntu (10.04 is recommended) and a user (suggested name: "mconf").

You need also some basic tools: git, curl and a ssh server. You can install them in Ubuntu with:

{{{
sudo apt-get install openssh-server git curl
}}}

From now on, you can either install everything manually or use the script `mconf-web-conf` to help you with these tasks:

  * [MconfWebDeploymentWithScript Using mconf-web-conf]. This is the easier option. If you chose this option, take a look at the manual installation if you're having problems.
  * [MconfWebDeploymentManual Manual installation].
