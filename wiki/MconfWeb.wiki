== Mconf-Web base ==

Mconf-Web is a fork of *VCC*.
VCC is open source and it's code can be found at https://github.com/ging/vcc

VCC is developed in Ruby on Rails 2.3.4 and uses Isabel to perform webconfereces. In Mconf-Web, we are improving VCC and integrating it with *BigBlueButton*

== Other libraries ==

  * *bigbluebutton-api-ruby* (https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton-api-ruby): A library to access the BigBlueButton API in Ruby applications. Developed to be used in Mconf-Web.

== How to start ==

Setting up the development environment:

  * Install ruby using rvm (http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)
    * Quick steps to install rvm (the project currently uses rvm 1.2.6):
        * Run: `bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )`
        * Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile:
          * `[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && . "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"  # This loads RVM into a shell session.`
        * Start a new prompt or load source in the current shell with: `source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm`
            * To check if it worked, run `type rvm | head -1` and it should output `rvm is a function`
        * Run `rvm notes` and install the packages under "For Ruby (MRI & ree)"
        * Mconf-Web uses rubygems 1.5.0. If needed, you can specify the version with: `rvm rubygems 1.5.0`
  * Install bundler: `gem install bundler`
  * Run `script/setup` to install the system packages needed
  * Run `bundle install` to install all gems
  * Configure the database and the mailer
    * The script `setup` will create these files for you, but you need to open and configure them
    * Database: `config/database.yml`    
    * Mailer: `config/initializers/mail_conf.rb`
  * Run `rake setup:development`

Then you can:

  * Start the server with `script/server` and navigate to `localhost:3000`
  * Run tests with `rake spec`
