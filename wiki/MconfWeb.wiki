= Mconf-Web =

Mconf-Web is the social network in the Mconf webconferencing system. It is (currently) a fork of VCC, and open source system that can be found [https://github.com/ging/vcc here] (read more about it in the end of this page). There are tons of improvements made in Mconf-Web if compared to VCC, you can see some of these improvements below.

Mconf-web is a web application that connects to a Mconf-Live/!BigBlueButton (works with both applications) server instance and allows the users to create and participate in webconferences. It provides functionalities that are (by design) not implemented in the core of Mconf-Live/!BigBlueButton, such as:

 * User authentication;
 * Permission control to access webconference rooms;
 * Follows a social network model (inherited from VCC) with spaces (communities) that have events;
 * Users have their own webconferences that they can share with other members or even invite non-members.
 * Each space also has a webconference room that its members can use to interact;
 * Events can be used to schedule webconferences inside a space.


== Try it ==

The instance of Mconf-Web used by Mconf is at: http://mconf.org/. This server is free for everyone to register and use to explore Mconf.


== Main differences between Mconf-Web and VCC ==

The project supporting VCC has ended in the end of 2010, so it's development has been stopped since then. You can see the new directions VCC's team has taken at their [https://github.com/ging github page].

VCC is developed in Ruby on Rails 2.3.4 and uses Isabel to perform webconfereces. The most important differences included by Mconf-Web are the use of *Rails 3* and the use of *!BigBlueButton* as a replacement for Isabel. But there are several other differences that you can see by ourself trying Mconf-Web at http://mconf.org.

== Integration with Mconf-Live/!BigBlueButton ==

Mconf-Web will always support the latest version of Mconf-Live. As for !BigBlueButton, it currently supports versions *0.7* and *0.8*.

The integration with Mconf-Live/!BigBlueButton is based on two gems (that are also being developed in the Mconf project):

  * *[https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton-api-ruby bigbluebutton-api-ruby]*: A library to access Mconf-Live/!BigBlueButton's API in Ruby applications. Developed on top of a gem called [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebuttongem/ bigbluebuttongem] to be used in Mconf-Web.

  * *[https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails bigbluebutton_rails]*: An integration of !BigBlueButton and Rails. It uses bigbluebutton-api-ruby to access !BigBlueButton's API.

== How to Start ==

To install Mconf-Web:

== Global Plaza ==

Global Plaza (also know as VCC - Virtual Conference Centre) is a project developed in Ruby on Rails to provide a virtual event service for the Internet. It uses the Isabel system to provide webconferencing.
