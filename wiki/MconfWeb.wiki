Mconf-Web is the social network in the Mconf webconferencing system.

It is (currently) a fork of *VCC*, and open source system that can be found [https://github.com/ging/vcc here].

Mconf-web is a web application that connects to a !BigBlueButton server instance and allows the users to create and participate in webconferences. It provides functionalities that are (by design) not implemented in the core of !BigBlueButton, such as:

 * User authentication;
 * Permission control to access webconference rooms;
 * Follows a social network model (inherited from VCC) with spaces (communities) that have events;
 * Users have their own webconferences that they can share with other members or even invite non-members.
 * Each space also has a webconference room that its members can use to interact;
 * Events can be used to schedule webconferences inside a space.

During the first phase of Mconf-web, we are strongly focusing on the integration with !BigBlueButton. This means that we want to have the basic libraries needed to integrate a Ruby on Rails application and !BigBlueButton fully functional and with all the features we need. The current Mconf-web is a test application for these libraries and is also an integration between !BigBlueButton and a modified version of VCC. In the future, it's possible that Mconf-web will change it's model or even move away from VCC.

== Demo ==

A demo server for Mconf-web can be found at: http://mconf.org/

This server is used for tests and demonstrations, so feel free to register yourself and use it to explore Mconf-web. Be aware that all the information (user data, files, comments, etc.) will be preserved for as long as possible, but we give no guarantee for how it will be.

If you find any bugs or have suggestions, please [http://code.google.com/p/mconf/issues/list file an issue] in our issue tracking system

== Differences between Mconf-web and VCC ==

The project supporting VCC has ended in the end of 2010, so it's development has been greatly reduced since then. You can see the new directions VCC's team has taken at their [https://github.com/ging github page].

VCC is developed in Ruby on Rails 2.3.4 and uses Isabel to perform webconfereces. The most important differences included by Mconf-web are the use of *Rails 3* and the use of *!BigBlueButton* as a replacement for Isabel.

== Integration with !BigBlueButton ==

Mconf-Web currently supports !BigBlueButton *0.7* and *0.8*.

The integration with !BigBlueButton is based on two gems (that are also being developed in the Mconf project):

  * *[https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton-api-ruby bigbluebutton-api-ruby]*: A library to access the !BigBlueButton API in Ruby applications. Developed on top of a gem called [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebuttongem/ bigbluebuttongem] to be used in Mconf-Web.

  * *[https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton_rails bigbluebutton_rails]*: An integration of BBB and Rails. It uses bigbluebutton-api-ruby to access the BBB API.
