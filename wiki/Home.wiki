= About the subprojects =
== Flazr - a Java implementation of multimedia streaming protocols ==

[http://flazr.com/ Flazr] is a very good implementation of the RTMP protocol with minimal dependencies. It was developed by Peter Thomas and it's licensed under LGPL.

We've had to "clone" the subversion repository of Flazr because we needed to adapt the library to support Remote Shared Objects. We've used part of the [http://red5.org/ Red5] source code - Red5 is an Open Source Flash Server written in Java. Red5 is also licensed under LGPL.

== BBB-Java ==

This is our Java implementation that uses Flazr to communicate with BigBlueButton Server. It could be used as an interface between any Java application and BBB. The code is licensed under GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

== BBB-Android ==

BBB-Android is our Android implementation of the BigBlueButton client. The code is licensed under GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

= If you want to run our app =
 # Install Android SDK ([http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html link])
 # Install Eclipse ([http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ link])
 # Configure the environment (Eclipse + Android SDK integration)
 # Install Apache Ant ([http://ant.apache.org/ link])
