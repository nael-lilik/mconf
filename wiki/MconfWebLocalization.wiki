= Translating Mconf-Web =

We use myGengo (http://mygengo.com/) to translate Mconf-Web to other languages. If you want to collaborate:

  * Create an account in http://mygengo.com/
  * Send us an email (mconf-dev@googlegroups.com) with:
    * Your email address used in myGengo;
    * The language you wish to translate Mconf-Web to (it can be either a new language or an already existent one).

We will then authorize your user to translate Mconf-Web to this language. Periodically we will download the files from myGengo and update Mconf-Web with them.

The languages maintained by the Mconf team are:
  * English
  * Portuguese (Brazil)


== Technical information ==

All the language files are inside the folder <tt>config/locales</tt> and they use the [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html YAML format]. There is a folder for each language and each of these folders contains one or more language files. All the files in these folders are automatically loaded when the application starts.

We also use a gem called "translate" to:

  * Keep all language files in the same standard format;
  * Remove strings that are not used anymore;
  * Detect strings that are not translated.

=== Development process ===

  * Add or remove keys or change values in the language 'en' only;
  * Upload these files to myGengo;
  * Translate to other languages using myGengo always;
  * Download all language files from myGengo and update the repository using the script 'mygengo'.

There is a script in `script/mygengo` that downloads all locale files from myGengo and runs some rake tasks on them to cleanup and adapt to Mconf. This script should be used everytime there's a need to update the locales.
