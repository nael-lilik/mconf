= Translating Mconf-Web =

Currently, the best way to translate Mconf-Web is to first [MconfWebDevelopment setup a development environment].

All the language files are inside the folder <tt>config/locales</tt> and they use the [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html YAML format].

The languages maintained by the Mconf team are:
  * English
  * Portuguese (Brazil)

See below how to *update an existent language*, *add a new language file* and how to *integrate your changes in Mconf-Web*.

=== Updating an existing language file ===

In the following examples, replace <tt>%locale%</tt> with the name of the locale you are trying to update ("de" for german, "fr" for french, and so on).

From your development environment, run:

{{{
BASE=en LOCALE=%locale% rake translate:add_untranslated TRANSLATE=1
}}}

This command will get everything that exists in "en" and does not exists in "%locale%" and add to it. Before doing that, it will translate the strings to the target language (using Google Translate).

Then you can just open the file and edit those new strings. You can also use any "diff application", such as [http://meld.sourceforge.net/ Meld]:

{{{
meld config/locales/%locale%.yml
}}}

=== Adding a new language file ===

First create your new language file in the folder <tt>config/locales</tt>. Name it <tt>%locale%</tt> and add to it these two lines:

{{{
--- 
%locale%:
}}}



=== Integrating your changes in Mconf-Web ===
