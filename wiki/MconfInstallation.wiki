Mconf has three main modules: Mconf-Web, Mconf-Mobile, and !BigBlueButton (with customizations). We are currently using !BigBlueButton 0.71a.

See below the options you have to get the complete solution:

  * *Using the Mconf VM*: This is the simplest solution. The current version of this VM comes with Mconf-Web, !BigBlueButton (0.71a) and its customizations already installed. All you'll need is to configure them (we provide scripts for that). The server is already "Mconf-Mobile"-enabled, so you can just [http://code.google.com/p/mconf/downloads/list install Mconf-Mobile] in your mobile device and use it in this VM.
    * More details in the [MconfVM Mconf VM page]

  * *If you already have a !BigBlueButton server*: Here you have more options. You can install Mconf-Web in the !BigBlueButton server machine or in a another machine. You can also decide if you will use the Mconf customizations for !BigBlueButton or not (it includes enabling Mconf-Mobile).
    * Install Mconf-Web *in a standalone server*: This is the recommended setup. See [MconfWebDeployment this page] to learn how to deploy Mconf-Web.
    * Install Mconf-Web *in the same machine that serves !BigBlueButton*: It works fine, but there's a small "gotcha" with the web server. Proceed to [MconfWebDeployInBBBMachine this page] for more information.

  * *Customizing !BigBlueButton*: We provide a script called `mconf-bbb-conf` that you can use to customize your !BigBlueButton server with our modifications. See [MconfBBB this page] for more details about it.

  * *Mconf-Mobile*: The first step is to [http://code.google.com/p/mconf/downloads/list download Mconf-Mobile] and install it in your device. For !BigBlueButton 0.71a, you will need some customizations in the server. If you're using the Mconf VM you already have this enabled. Otherwise, you can either do that manually (see [MconfMobile this page]) or customizing !BigBlueButton using the `mconf-bbb-conf` script (see the previous item).
