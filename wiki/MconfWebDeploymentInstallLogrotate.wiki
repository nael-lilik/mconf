[http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/logrotate8.html Logrotate] is a utility that prevents logs from getting to big creating new files and compacting the old ones.

You server should already have it installed, but if it doesn't, install it with:

{{{
sudo apt-get install logrotate
}}}

The configuration file for logrotate can be copied from Mconf-Web's repository with:

{{{
sudo curl https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/latest/config/logrotate/mconf-web -o /etc/logrotate.d/mconf-web
}}}

If you have Mconf-Web installed in a path other than `/home/mconf/mconf-web/current`, you will have to edit the  application path in the configuration file above.

Then set the permissions and activate logrotate:

{{{
sudo chown root:root /etc/logrotate.d/mconf-web
sudo chmod 644 /etc/logrotate.d/mconf-web
sudo logrotate -s /var/lib/logrotate/status /etc/logrotate.d/mconf-web
}}}

If the last command doesn't print any errors, it should be working. Check the `log` folder inside your Mconf-Web to see if the log files have been changed.
