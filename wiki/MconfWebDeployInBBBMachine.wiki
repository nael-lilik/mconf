= Mconf-Web Deployment with !BigBlueButton = 

You can setup a Mconf-Web server in the same machine that already has !BigBlueButton. This page contains some considerations about it.

What you have to consider is the web server you will use for Mconf-Web. See the sections below.

== Use Mconf-Web with Apache and !BigBlueButton with Nginx ==

This is the default solution, and requires just a few configurations on both web servers. 

If you deploy Mconf-Web [MconfWebDeploymentWithScript using our script] it will already detect that !BigBlueButton is installed and, if you choose to install Apache, it will configure both Apache and Nginx to work with both applications.

If you can't use the script for some reason, here are some guidelines of what you need to configure in Apache and Nginx.

=== Manual configuration ===

If you know some bash script you can take a look at the following section in [https://github.com/mconf/mconf-web/blob/master/script/mconf-web-conf our script] and you will find out how to configure the web servers:

{{{
if [ $SETUP_PROD ]; then
...
    is_bigbluebutton_installed
    if [ $REPLY ]; then
        # here is where we ask the user what to do since BigBlueButton is installed
        # and if he chooses to install Apache we will do it automatically.
...
}}}

The first steps are:

{{{
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default     # Disable the default config in nginx that uses the port 80
sudo bbb-conf --setip $IP:$PORT              # Tell BBB to respond in another port
}}}

_In these examples, replace $IP with your machine's IP and $PORT with the port you want for !BigBlueButton_

!BigBlueButton should respond in a port different than 80, since Mconf-Web will use the port 80. By default our script changes it to port 8888, but you can use another one if you want to. 

Next, we install Apache using Passenger. Passenger is a ruby gem that serves Ruby on Rails applications. You need to have Ruby installed at this point and then install Passenger with "`gem install passenger`". With Passenger installed, use the following command to install Apache and the needed modules:

{{{
rvmsudo passenger-install-apache2-module
}}}

This will start an interactive application that will help you install all you need.

After, we cleanup Apache and setup Mconf-Web. In the following commands `$APACHE_PATH` is the path where Apache is, usually `/etc/apache2`.

Enable the module "rewrite" and disable any default site existent:

{{{
sudo ln -f -s $APACHE_PATH/mods-available/rewrite.load $APACHE_PATH/mods-enabled/rewrite.load
sudo rm $APACHE_PATH/sites-enabled/*
}}}

Enable Passenger in Apache:

{{{
rvmsudo passenger-install-apache2-module --snippet | sudo tee /etc/apache2/conf.d/mconf-passenger
}}}

Then let's configure and create the Mconf-Web virtual host. You can copy [https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/master/config/apache2.conf.example this example file], edit it and copy to `$APACHE_PATH/sites-enabled/mconf-web`. Our script does it with these commands:

{{{
TEMP=`mktemp`
curl https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-web/master/config/apache2.conf.example -o $TEMP
sudo sed -i "s#ServerName .*#ServerName $IP#g" $TEMP
sudo sed -i "s#DocumentRoot .*#DocumentRoot /home/firstuser/mconf-web/current/public#g" $TEMP
sudo sed -i "s#<Directory .*>#<Directory /home/firstuser/mconf-web/current/public>#g" $TEMP
sudo mv $TEMP $APACHE_PATH/sites-available/mconf-web
sudo ln -f -s $APACHE_PATH/sites-available/mconf-web $APACHE_PATH/sites-enabled/mconf-web &>/dev/null
}}}

Then restart Apache:

{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
}}}


With this you have the production server up and ready to receive a deployed Mconf-Web. To deploy, you can again use our script or do it manually. Proceed to [MconfWebDeployment this page] to learn how to do that.
