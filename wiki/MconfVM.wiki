= Mconf VM =

The Mconf VM comes with the whole Mconf package in a single virtual machine, to enable easy access to all Mconf's features. This VM is intended for *testing/development* purposes, it is not recommended for a production environment.

For more options on how to install Mconf see [MconfInstallation this page].

== Prerequisites ==

  * VMWare Player (or VMWare Workstation) for Windows or Unix, or VM Fusion for Mac
  * A DHCP Server for the VM to acquire an IP address

== Installing Mconf VM ==

Follow the steps below to setup the Mconf VM. It will take around 20 minutes (considering you can download files at ~150 KiB/s):

  * Download the VM, unzip and run the file `mconf-vm.vmx`
    * _<font color=red>TODO: vm link</font>_

  * Login using the username "`firstuser`" and password "`default`"
    * You will be prompted to change your password. Enter the "default" once and then enter the new password twice.

  * After the login, run the setup script with:
    {{{
./mconf-vm
    }}}

    When it runs, you will be soon prompted for a password to run commands as root. Type in *the new password you just configured for your account*.

    The script will then start to apply Mconf's customizations to this BigBlueButton instance (~8 minutes). 

    Some minutes later the script will start setting up Mconf-Web and it will ask you to configure some parameters. See the figure below:

    http://mconf.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/mconf-vm-setup1.png

    The parameters you will be asked for a value are:
      * *admin_email* (Admin user email): This is the email of the admin user in Mconf-Web. Use a valid email, you'll need it to administrate your server.
      * *admin_password* (Admin user password): The password for the admin user. You can set a password here our you can leave the default value and change it later using the website.
      * *sendmail_username* (Gmail account username): A Gmail account to be used to send any email sent from within Mconf-Web. Currently you need to set this account properly or the setup of Mconf-Web will fail.
      * *sendmail_password* (Gmail account password): The password of the Gmail account to send emails.

    Short after you will also be asked to enter a password for the deployment of Mconf-Web (image below). Enter *the password of your current user in the VM*. This is needed because the application is being deployed using ssh, so you're ssh'ing into your own machine.

  * Now just relax and wait for the setup to finish (~8 minutes).

  * When the setup finishes, it will print in the screen your IP and ask you to access it using your browser to test if the setup was successful. Hopefully everything will work well, but if you're facing any problems you can try to find an answer in the [MconfTroubleshoot troubleshoot page] or send a message to our mailing list: mconf-dev@googlegroups.com

== Details ==

The Mconf VM runs over the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/BigBlueButtonVM BigBlueButton VM] (Ubuntu 10.04). What you have in this machine:

  * !BigBlueButton 0.71a installed from Ubuntu packages
  * !BigBlueButton's source code with Mconf's customizations, from our repository at https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton
  * Mconf-Web production and development environments

This VM comes with the entire system already pre-configured, but there are still some things that are related to each instance of the VM. That's why `mconf-vm` exists, to help you configure these parameters.
