= Mconf VM =

The Mconf VM comes with the whole Mconf package in a single virtual machine, to enable easy access to all Mconf's features. This VM is intended for *testing/development* purposes, it is not recommended for a production environment.

For more options on how to install Mconf see [MconfInstallation this page].

== How To ==

Quick steps to setup the Mconf VM:
  * Download the VM, unzip and run the file mconf-vm.vmx
    * _<font color=red>TODO: vm link</font>_
  * Login with username "`firstuser`" and password "`default`"
    * You will be prompted to change your password
  * Run the setup script with:
    {{{
cd ~ && ./mconf-vm
    }}}

== Details ==

The Mconf VM runs over the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/BigBlueButtonVM BigBlueButton VM] (Ubuntu 10.04). What you have in this machine:

  * !BigBlueButton 0.71a installed from Ubuntu packages
  * !BigBlueButton's source code with Mconf's customizations, from our repository at https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton
  * Mconf-Web production and development environments

This VM comes with the entire system already pre-configured, but there are still some things that are related to each instance of the VM. That's why the `mconf-vm` exists, to help you configure these parameters.

== About `mconf-vm` ==

When it runs, at first the script will do several things on its own. At the end it will start setting up Mconf-Web and it requires user input.
