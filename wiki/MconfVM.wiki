= Mconf VM =

The Mconf VM comes with the whole Mconf package in a single virtual machine, to enable easy access to all Mconf's features. This VM is intended for *testing/development* purposes, it is not recommended for a production environment.

For more options on how to install Mconf see [MconfInstallation this page].

== Prerequisites ==

  * VMWare Player (or VMWare Workstation) for Windows or Unix, or VM Fusion for Mac
  * A DHCP Server for the VM to acquire an IP address

== Installing Mconf VM ==

Quick steps to setup the Mconf VM:
  * Download the VM, unzip and run the file `mconf-vm.vmx`
    * _<font color=red>TODO: vm link</font>_

  * Login with username "`firstuser`" and password "`default`"
    * You will be prompted to change your password

  * Run the setup script with:
    {{{
cd ~ && ./mconf-vm
    }}}

    When it runs, at first the script will do several things on its own. At the end it will start setting up Mconf-Web and it requires user input.

    The parameters you will be asked for a value are:
      * *admin_email* (Admin user email): This is the email of the admin user in Mconf-Web. Use a valid email, you'll need it to administrate your server.
      * *admin_password* (Admin user password): The password for the admin user. You can set a password here our you can leave the default value and change it later using the website.
      * *sendmail_username* (Gmail account username): A Gmail account to be used to send any email sent from within Mconf-Web. Currently you need to set this account properly or the setup of Mconf-Web will fail.
      * *sendmail_password* (Gmail account password): The password of the Gmail account to send emails.

== Details ==

The Mconf VM runs over the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/BigBlueButtonVM BigBlueButton VM] (Ubuntu 10.04). What you have in this machine:

  * !BigBlueButton 0.71a installed from Ubuntu packages
  * !BigBlueButton's source code with Mconf's customizations, from our repository at https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton
  * Mconf-Web production and development environments

This VM comes with the entire system already pre-configured, but there are still some things that are related to each instance of the VM. That's why `mconf-vm` exists, to help you configure these parameters.

  * System user:
    * login: firstuser
    * password: default
  * MySQL user:
    * login: root
