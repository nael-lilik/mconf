= Tips for MySQL =

== Setting up passwords ==

To set up a new password for a user in MySQL you can use:

{{{
mysqladmin -u mconf password "NEW-PASSWORD" # Use the quotes, they are not part of the password
}}}

Or, in case you want to change the password:

{{{
mysqladmin -u mconf -p password "NEW-PASSWORD"
}}}

== Create databases and users ==

This is an example of how to create a user `mconf` and a database `mconf_production` in MySQL.

{{{
mysql -u mconf -p # first open mysql

# then, inside mysql:
CREATE USER 'mconf'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
CREATE DATABASE mconf_production;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mconf_production.* TO "mconf"@"localhost" IDENTIFIED BY "password";
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
}}}

== Backup ==

{{{
# backup
mysqldump -u mconf -p mconf_production > mconf_production-`date +%F`.sql

# restore
mysql -u mconf -p mconf_production < mconf_production-2011-06-21.sql
}}}
