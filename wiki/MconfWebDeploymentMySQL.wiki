= Tips for MySQL =

== Setting up passwords ==

To set up a new password for a user in MySQL you can use:

{{{
mysqladmin -u root password "NEW-PASSWORD" # Use the quotes, they are not part of the password
}}}

Or, in case you want to change the password:

{{{
mysqladmin -u root -p password "NEW-PASSWORD"
}}}

== Create a database and a user ==

This is an example of how to create a user `mconf` and a database `mconf_production` in MySQL.

{{{
mysql -u mconf -p # first open mysql

# in the commands below insert in "password" the actual password
# inside mysql, run:
CREATE USER "mconf"@"localhost" IDENTIFIED BY "password";
CREATE DATABASE mconf_production;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mconf_production.* TO "mconf"@"localhost" IDENTIFIED BY "password";
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
}}}

== Backup ==

Backup the current db:

{{{
mysqldump -u mconf -p mconf_production > mconf_production-`date +%F`.sql
}}}

Restore a backup:

{{{
mysql -u mconf -p mconf_production < mconf_production-xxxx-xx-xx.sql
}}}
