= About the subprojects =
== Flazr - a Java implementation of multimedia streaming protocols ==

[http://flazr.com/ Flazr] is a very good implementation of the RTMP protocol with minimal dependencies. It was developed by Peter Thomas and it's licensed under LGPL.

We've had to "clone" the subversion repository of Flazr because we needed to adapt the library to support Remote Shared Objects. We've used part of the [http://red5.org/ Red5] source code - Red5 is an Open Source Flash Server written in Java. Red5 is also licensed under LGPL.

== BBB-Java ==

This is our Java implementation that uses Flazr to communicate with BigBlueButton Server. It is a client-side API and could be used as an interface between any Java application and BBB. The code is licensed under GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

== BBB-Android ==

BBB-Android is our Android implementation of the BigBlueButton client. The code is licensed under GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

*Update:* since March 2011 we changed the license of BBB-Android to GNU General Public Licence (GPL) because we started to use [http://sipdroid.org/ Sipdroid] for audio interaction. Sipdroid is a free SIP/VoIP client for Android and it's licensed under GNU General Public License (GPL).

= Running the app =

There are two ways of running the application:

 # If you want to run the application with your integrated environment (like Moodle), you need to provide custom urls for the BigBlueButton calls, replacing the protocol *`http://`* with *`bigbluebutton://`*
 # If you want to run the application standalone, the server you are going to connect must provide the demo *`mobile.jsp`*. To do that, copy [https://raw.github.com/mconf/mconf-mobile/v0.3beta/mobile.jsp this file] to *`/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/bigbluebutton/demo/`*.

We provide mobile access in our development server at http://mconfdev.inf.ufrgs.br.

= Building the app from the repository =

 # Install Android SDK ([http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html link])
 # Install Eclipse ([http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ link])
 # Configure the environment (Eclipse + Android SDK integration) ([http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html link])
 # Install Apache Ant ([http://ant.apache.org/ link])
 # Install Android NDK by CrystaX.Net ([http://www.crystax.net/android/ndk-r4.php link])
 # Clone the repository
 # Run *`ant dist`* inside *`flazr/`*
 # Run *`./<NDK-DIR>/ndk-build`* inside *`bbb-android`*
 # Import all the projects in your workspace on Eclipse
 # Just wait while Eclipse build the code
 # Run *`bbb-android`* as an Android application

A full documentation for Android developers is available [http://developer.android.com/index.html here].

= How could I contribute? =

If you are not a developer, the best you can do is testing the Android application and provide us any feedback. It could be done by [http://code.google.com/p/mconf/issues/list creating a new issue] reporting a bug or specifying an enhancement. Also you can send messages to the [http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev BigBlueButton developers mailing list]. If you are interested in translate the Android application to another language different from Portuguese (PT-BR) and English, send us a message and we will provide a way to do that (of course, better translations of the supported languages are welcome). :)

If you are a developer and want to be part of this project, you can pick an issue and try to solve it. Of course we are totally open to help you in what you need.
