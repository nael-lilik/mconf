=== Problems running the rake tasks to setup a development or production environment ===

==== Error: "Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at" ====

If you're running the rake task `db:seed` (or any other task that triggers this task, like `setup:db`) and you're facing this error:

{{{
 ** [out :: 127.0.0.1] * Create the administrator account
 ...
 ** [out :: 127.0.0.1] rake aborted!
 ** [out :: 127.0.0.1] 535-5.7.1 Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at
 ** [out :: 127.0.0.1] 
 ** [out :: 127.0.0.1] (See full trace by running task with --trace)
}}}

It means that the parameters `sendmail_username` and/or `sendmail_password` in your configuration file (`config/setup_conf.yml`) are not correct. See more about this file [MconfWebSetupConf at this page].
