=== Problems running the rake tasks to setup a development or production environment ===

==== Error: "Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at" ====

If you're running the rake task `db:seed` (or any other task that triggers this task, like `setup:db`) and you're facing this error:

{{{
* Create the administrator account
...
rake aborted!
535-5.7.1 Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at
(See full trace by running task with --trace)
}}}

It means that the parameters `sendmail_username` and/or `sendmail_password` in your configuration file (`config/setup_conf.yml`) are not correct. See more about this file [MconfWebSetupConf at this page].

==== Mysql2 related errors ====

The following box shows an example of an error that occurs when your Mysql2 user and/or password are wrong and you're trying to setup Mconf-Web. The following error has happened trying to setup a production environment using the wrong database password for the user "root".

{{{
Couldn't drop mconf_production : #<Mysql2::Error: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)>
* Running the task: db:create
Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES).
Please provide the root password for your mysql installation
}}}

The database username and password are configured in the file `config/database.yml`. See more about this file [MconfWebDatabaseConf at this page].

==== Emails are not being sent ====

The emails are sent using a background job run by the gem delayed_job. If you're in a development environment, you can run it with:

{{{
bundle exec script/delayed_job -n 2 start
}}}

If you're using Capistrano, you can run the task "jobs:start" to start delayed_job in the production server. For example:

{{{
cap production jobs:restart
}}}

You should see messages like the ones below when delayed_job is started:

{{{
 ** [out :: mconf.inf.ufrgs.br] delayed_job.0: process with pid 4752 started.
 ** [out :: mconf.inf.ufrgs.br] delayed_job.1: process with pid 4758 started.
