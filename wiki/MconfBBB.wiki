= Mconf-!BigBlueButton =

Mconf actively develops improvements and modifications for !BigBlueButton to generate the software we call Mconf-!BigBlueButton. Some of these modifications are in our [https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton fork of BigBlueButton] and some are just configuration that must be made in each instance of Mconf-!BigBlueButton.

Mconf-!BigBlueButton is currently a customized version of the latest !BigBlueButton, with improvements that may be available in future versions of !BigBlueButton.

If you intend to *join the [http://mconf.org/m/about/network Mconf Web Conference Network]*, please send an e-mail to mconf AT mconf.org saying you are going to setup a Mconf Node, so we will know who is in charge of that server. And then proceed to install the server as specified below.

If you only want to install Mconf-!BigBlueButton but you *don't want to join the network*, you will need to look at the [https://github.com/mconf/installation-scripts/blob/master/install-mconf-node.sh installation script] and install everything except the [https://github.com/mconf/installation-scripts/blob/master/install-mconf-node.sh#L50 server monitor]. If you have any doubts contact us at our mailing list (you can see the address at http://mconf.org/m/about/contact).

== Install Mconf-!BigBlueButton and join the Mconf Network ==

We have written a shell script to automatically install and configure a Mconf-!BigBlueButton instance, exactly the same system we are using on [https://mconf.org mconf.org]. The script will also install some tools so that your server will *automatically join* the Mconf Network, which you will be able to monitor through the [http://lb.mconf.org/dashboard Mconf Dashboard].

You can read more about the Mconf Network at: http://mconf.org/m/about/network

=== First steps ===

As soon as you set up your server, it will start being monitored by the Mconf Monitoring Tool, but you won't see your server yet on the [http://lb.mconf.org/dashboard Mconf Dashboard] because it is disabled by default. This is just a security step - your server will join the Mconf Global Webconference Network only after we receive an e-mail containing:

 * The server domain name
 * The institution name
 * The name and e-mail of the technician responsible for that server


=== Using the script ===

You can find the latest version of this file at: https://github.com/mconf/installation-scripts/blob/master/install-mconf-node.sh

<font color="red">*IMPORTANT:*</font> 
 * This script should be executed by a non-root user in a fresh dedicated *Ubuntu 10.04 Server* installation. It won't work on different versions of Ubuntu or other distributions;
 * Check if your server meets [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/FAQ#What_are_the_minimum_hardware_requirements_for_the_BigBlueButton BigBlueButton's minimum hardware requirements];
 * Be sure that you have opened for external access the ports TCP 80 (HTTP), TCP 9123 (Desktop Sharing), TCP 1935 (RTMP) and UDP 5060 (SIP);
 * If you intend to use a domain name (like "mconf.org"), set that up before continuing.

To setup the Mconf Node, run in your server:

{{{
wget https://github.com/mconf/installation-scripts/raw/master/install-mconf-node.sh
chmod +x install-mconf-node.sh
./install-mconf-node.sh <DOMAIN_NAME>
}}}

What the script does:
 * Upgrades the Ubuntu packages to the lastest 10.04 version;
 * Install BigBlueButton as described [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/08InstallationUbuntu#Installation_of_BigBlueButton_0.8 here]
 * Installs the Live Notes Server;
 * Install the Mconf Monitor;
 * Deploys the Mconf modifications on !BigBlueButton;
 * Sets a default presentation;
 * Enables FreeSWITCH to accept external calls (details [MconfFAQ#Voice_connection_timeout here]).

The !BigBlueButton demos will also be installed, but should be used only for testing purposes - after the validation test, you should remove them running:

{{{
sudo apt-get purge bbb-demo
}}}

== Other tips ==

During the installation:

 * You will be asked for the `sudo` password
 * You will be asked to accept the EULA for !TrueType core fonts
 * When you get the following message, press Ctrl+C only once:
{{{
     [exec] Finalized, press Ctrl + C to quit
}}}
 * When the whole script finishes, reboot the server

During the first start up after the installation the Live Notes Server will take a couple of minutes to start properly.
