= Mconf - !BigBlueButton Customizations =

Mconf uses a customized version of !BigBlueButton. Some of these modifications are in our [https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton fork of BigBlueButton] and some are just configuration that must be made in each instance of !BigBlueButton.

These customizations can be applied to a !BigBlueButton instance using [MconfBBB#Installation_script our script].


== List of modifications ==

 * Possibility to specify in the configuration file which resolutions the user can use during the conference;
 * Improved the video windows resize;
 * A video dock to organize video windows;
 * The right configuration to enable Speex audio codec, which improves the audio quality.

== Installation script ==

We have written a shell script to automatically configure a !BigBlueButton 0.71a environment to use exactly the same system we are using on [https://mconf.org mconf.org]. *This script is for a development environment* - to setup the !BigBlueButton 0.71a development environment, please follow [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/BigBlueButtonVM this steps].

You can find the latest version of this file in [https://github.com/mconf/installation-scripts this repository].

To apply the modifications, download the script and run it in your !BigBlueButton development server:

{{{
wget https://raw.github.com/mconf/installation-scripts/master/mconf-bbb-conf
chmod a+x mconf-bbb-conf
./mconf-bbb-conf
}}}

The script does:
 * download the source code from Mconf repository
 * install some dependencies (like Apache Ant)
 * add an environment variable to `~/.profile`
 * setup the development environment for the client, web and apps
 * compile and deploy all the components
 * download the application to enable mobile support
 * restart the server
