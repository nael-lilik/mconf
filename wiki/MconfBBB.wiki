= Mconf - !BigBlueButton Customizations =

Mconf uses a customized version of !BigBlueButton. Some of these modifications are in our [https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton fork of BigBlueButton] and some are just configuration that must be made in each instance of !BigBlueButton.

*If you intend to join the Mconf Global Webconference Network, please send an e-mail to mconf AT mconf.org saying you are going to setup a Mconf Node, so we will know who is in charge of that server.*

== Installation script ==

We have written a shell script to automatically install and configure a !BigBlueButton 0.8 with the Mconf customizations in a fresh server, exactly the same system we are using on [https://mconf.org mconf.org]. This server will join automatically the Mconf collaborative cloud, which you will be able to monitor through the [http://lb.mconf.org/dashboard Mconf Dashboard].

You can find the latest version of this file in [https://github.com/mconf/installation-scripts this repository].

<font color="red">*IMPORTANT:*</font> 
 * This script should be executed by a non-root user in a fresh dedicated Ubuntu 10.04 Server installation. It won't work on different versions of Ubuntu or other distributions;
 * Check if your server meets the [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/FAQ#What_are_the_minimum_hardware_requirements_for_the_BigBlueButton BigBlueButton minimum hardware requirements];
 * Be sure that you have opened for external access the ports 80 (HTTP), 22 (SSH), 9123 (Desktop Sharing) and 1935 (RTMP);
 * If you intend to use a domain name (like *mconf.org*), set up that before continue.

To setup the Mconf Node, run in your server:

{{{
wget https://github.com/mconf/installation-scripts/raw/master/install-mconf-node.sh
chmod +x install-mconf-node.sh
./install-mconf-node.sh <DOMAIN_NAME>
}}}

The script does:
 * upgrade the Ubuntu packages to the lastest 10.04 version
 * install !BigBlueButton as described [http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/08InstallationUbuntu#Installation_of_BigBlueButton_0.8 here]
 * install the Live Notes Server
 * install the Mconf Monitor
 * deploy the Mconf modifications on !BigBlueButton
 * set the Mconf default presentation
 * enable FreeSWITCH to accept external calls (details [MconfFAQ#Voice_connection_timeout here])

The !BigBlueButton Demos will be installed as well, but should be used only for testing purposes - after the validation test, you should remove them running:

{{{
sudo apt-get purge bbb-demo
}}}


== During the installation ==

 * You will be asked for the `sudo` password
 * You will be asked to accept the EULA for !TrueType core fonts
 * When you get the following message, press Ctrl+C only once:
{{{
     [exec] Finalized, press Ctrl + C to quit
}}}
 * When the whole script finishes, reboot the server

During the first start up after the installation the Live Notes Server will take a couple of minutes to start properly.
