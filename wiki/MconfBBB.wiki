= Mconf - !BigBlueButton Customizations =

Mconf uses a customized version of !BigBlueButton. Some of these modifications are in our [https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton fork of BigBlueButton] and some are just configuration changes that must be made in each instance of !BigBlueButton (you can see them in [https://github.com/mconf/installation-scripts/blob/master/mconf-bbb-conf this file])
