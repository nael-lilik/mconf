<font color=red>Important: </font> These modifications are for !BigBlueButton 0.71a. If you are using !BigBlueButton 0.8, all of these customizations will already be enabled.

= Mconf - !BigBlueButton Customizations =

Mconf uses a customized version of !BigBlueButton. Some of these modifications are in our [https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton fork of BigBlueButton] and some are just configuration that must be made in each instance of !BigBlueButton.

These customizations can be applied to a !BigBlueButton instance using [MconfBBB#Installation_script our script].


== List of modifications ==

 * Possibility to specify in the configuration file which resolutions the user can use during the conference;
 * Improved the video windows resize;
 * A video dock to organize video windows;
 * The right configuration to enable Speex audio codec, which improves the audio quality.

== Installation script ==

We have written a shell script to automatically install and configure a !BigBlueButton 0.8 with the Mconf customizations in a fresh server, exactly the same system we are using on [https://mconf.org mconf.org]. This server will join automatically the Mconf collaborative cloud, which you will be able to monitor through the [http://lb.mconf.org/dashboard Mconf Dashboard].

You can find the latest version of this file in [https://github.com/mconf/installation-scripts this repository].

<font color="red">IMPORTANT:</font> this script should be executed by a non-root user in a fresh Ubuntu 10.04 Server installation. It shouldn't work on different versions of Ubuntu and other distributions.

To install it, SSH your server and execute:

{{{
wget https://github.com/mconf/installation-scripts/raw/master/install-mconf-node.sh
chmod +x install-mconf-node.sh
./install-mconf-node.sh
}}}

The script does:
 * download the source code from Mconf repository
 * install some dependencies (like Apache Ant)
 * add an environment variable to `~/.profile`
 * setup the development environment for the client, web and apps
 * compile and deploy all the components
 * download the application to enable mobile support
 * restart the server
