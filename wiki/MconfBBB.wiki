= Mconf - !BigBlueButton Customizations =

Mconf uses a customized version of !BigBlueButton. Some of these modifications are in our [https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton fork of BigBlueButton] and some are just configuration changes that must be made in each instance of !BigBlueButton.

These customizations can be applied to a !BigBlueButton instance using the [MconfBBBInstallScript mconf-bbb-conf script].
