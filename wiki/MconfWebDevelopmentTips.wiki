== Sending emails in development ==

E-mails are sent by `delayed_job`, so you must run it's daemon:

{{{
rake jobs:clear                 # if you don't clear, all emails stored in the delayed_job table will be sent
script/delayed_job -n 2 start   # start 2 daemons
script/delayed_job stop         # to stop the daemons later
}}}

== Testing ==
